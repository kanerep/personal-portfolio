# **ChainEdge – Advanced Cross-Chain Trading Analytics Platform**

ChainEdge is a high-performance Web3 tool for traders who want real-time, cross-chain insights. I was brought on to design and build the marketing site. The goal was to create a fast, visually rich experience that clearly communicates the product’s value and builds trust with potential users.

### **My Role**

- Built the entire frontend using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** with a focus on speed, responsiveness, and long-term maintainability
- Designed a **high-contrast, dark-themed interface** with glowing accents to reflect the data-rich, technical nature of the product
- Developed a full set of reusable components including the **hero section, feature highlights, testimonials, pricing plans, and FAQ**
- Implemented **subtle micro-interactions** to make the site feel dynamic and polished
- Worked closely with the founder to translate the product’s identity into a clean, conversion-friendly layout

### **Highlights**

- Fully responsive layout built mobile-first and tested across breakpoints
- Modular sections make it easy to iterate and scale the site over time
- Clear UX structure designed around conversion, helping users quickly understand the value of the product

### **Result**

ChainEdge now has a professional and trustworthy landing experience that reflects the quality of the product. It’s built for speed and clarity, giving the team a strong foundation to scale their user base and communicate with potential customers and partners.
