# **RF Heating Website – Clean, Responsive Site for a Local Trade Business**

RF Heating is a plumbing and heating company based in the UK. They had **no previous website** and needed a **clean, mobile-friendly solution** to showcase their services, build trust with new customers, and make it easier for people to get in touch. While they had a basic social media presence, it wasn’t actively used. This was their **first real step toward building an online presence**.

I came in as a **long-term digital partner**, starting with the website and laying the groundwork for further enhancements.

### **My Role**

I handled the entire build, from early planning through to development and deployment:

- Built with **Next.js App Router** using **React Server Components**, and **server-side rendering** for speed and SEO

- Developed a **fully responsive UI** using **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn UI**

- Structured the project with **clean, modular components** for future scalability

- Helped define key content areas, services, and **trust elements** like certifications and testimonials

- Built a **custom enquiry form** with **SendGrid integration** to automate lead routing and save the client admin time

- Deployed to **Netlify** with **automated previews and builds**

### **How I Worked**

We started with a **planning session** to map out core content, identify customer questions, and highlight opportunities to save time. The client was collaborative and trusted my input, which let me take the lead on layout and structure.

Throughout the project, I kept them updated through **quick demos, screenshots**, and instant messages to make the process smooth and transparent.

### **Highlights**

- **Fast page loads** with optimised images and dynamic imports

- **Mobile-first layout** with accessibility handled using **Radix UI**

- Fully type-safe using **TypeScript** and **Zod** for validation

- **Trust-building content** featuring real photos, accreditations, and customer-friendly language

- **Form automation** to reduce time spent managing leads

### **Result**

The site is **fully built and deployed to staging**. We’re currently waiting on the final content and images before going live. Once launched, RF Heating will have a **professional, conversion-ready website** that matches the quality of their work and helps generate new leads.
